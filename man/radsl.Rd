\description{
Function for generating random Subject-Level Analysis Dataset
}
\details{
The Subject-Level Analysis Data set (ADSL) is used to provide
 the variables that describe attributes of a subject. ADSL is a source
 for subject-level variables used in other analysis data sets, such as
 population flags and treatment variables. There is only one ADSL per
 study. ADSL and its related metadata are required in a CDISC-based
 submission of data from a clinical trial even if no other analysis data
 sets are submitted.

ADSL <- radsl()
